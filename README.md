Smart India Hackathon 2025 Submission
This project is the official submission for the Smart India Hackathon 2025 by Team The Peace Pals.

Problem Statement ID: SIH25092

Problem Statement Title: Development of a Digital Mental Health and Psychological Support System for Students in Higher Education

Theme: MedTech / BioTech / Health Tech

📖 About The Project
SereneSpace is a safe, anonymous, and personalized mental wellness platform built to help students navigate the pressures of academic life. Our core principle is to offer an anonymous user journey, encouraging students to seek help without fear of judgment or stigma.

Users begin with a simple mood check-in, which generates a personalized dashboard with AI-curated recommendations, activities, and resources tailored to their emotional state. Built with Python & Flask, SereneSpace aims to create a healthier, more supportive, and mentally resilient academic environment for students across India.
